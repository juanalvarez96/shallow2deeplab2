# Laboratory 2. UniversitéCôte d'Azur-Polytech-Nice-Sophia

Image comparison laboratory.
The purpose of this lab is to use the basic opencv methods for matching images.
In this laboratory, I prove that two images from the same family (i.e. two images from a 50km/h limit speed sign) can have less matches than two images from different families (i.e. one image form a 50km/h speed limit and a truck priority traffic sign). This comparison is done counting the number of matches between each pair of images.

The comparison is done using a FLANN based matcher from the opencv library.
